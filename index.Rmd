## About me {#about}

My research revolves around the fields of phonetics, phonology, sociolinguistics, and quantitative methodology. A lot of my work has looked at the temporal/dynamic properties of vowel production, such as diphthongs, from both phonological and phonetic points of view.

I am a graduate of the 
[University of Manitoba](http://www.umanitoba.ca/linguistics/){target="_blank"} (B.A. and M.A.) and the 
[University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/linguistics/){target="_blank"} (Ph.D.).

My academic work and research experience includes teaching courses in Linguistics at the 
[University of Manitoba](http://www.umanitoba.ca/linguistics/){target="_blank"}, the 
[University of Winnipeg](https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/interdisciplinary-linguistics/index.html){target="_blank"}, and 
[Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/linguistics.html){target="_blank"}, serving as a research assistant and lab instructor at the 
[University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/linguistics/){target="_blank"}, presenting at a variety of linguistics conferences large and small, and volunteering as editor and conference organizer on multiple occasions. 

[My academic CV](pdf/OnossonCV.pdf){target="_blank"} contains much more information on all of the above. I also have an [industry-facing resume](pdf/OnossonResume.pdf){target="_blank"} for non-academic purposes, should they arise.

## Research projects {#projects}

I am currently involved in several active research projects which include, in no particular order:

* **Variation and change in contemporary *Brazilian Portuguese*.** Since 2015, in collaboration with [Christiani Pinheiro Thompson](https://artsandscience.usask.ca/linguistics/graduates/current-graduate-students.php){target="_blank"} (University of Saskatchewan), we have recorded more than 80 multi-media intervews with nearly 180 middle-school children in urban Rio de Janeiro. We recently presented some of our findings at the [Canadian Linguistic Association 2021
meeting](pdf/Thompson, Onosson - 2021 - Canadian Linguistic Association.pdf){target="_blank"}, and are preparing a related article with several others also in the works.

* **The vowels of *Media Lengua*.** This project is a collaboration with [Dr. Jesse Stewart](http://www.jessestewart.net/){target="_blank"} (University of Saskatchewan). Media Lengua is a mixed language spoken in Ecuador whose lexicon is mainly Spanish-origin, fitted into a vowel system which derives from that of Quichua. Our current work focuses on how vowel-sequences from different-origin source languages are handled in Media Lengua, from both phonetic and phonological perspectives. Two papers resulting from this collaboration have recently been published by [Language and Speech](pdf/Onosson, Stewart - 2021 - Language and Speech.pdf){target="_blank"} and [Laboratory Phonology](pdf/Onosson, Stewart - 2021 - Laboratory Phonology preprint.pdf){target="_blank"}.

* **Ethnoloinguistic variation in *Manitoba/Prairie English*.** This research is centred on [Dr. Nicole Rosen's](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~rosenn/){target="_blank"} Canada Research Chair-funded [*Languages in the Prairies Project*](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~rosenn/sace.html){target="_blank"} (LIPP). I have documented some distinctive ethnolinguistic patterns in some phonological processes within the Filipino and Mennonite communities in Manitoba, leading to two [conference presentations](pdf/Onosson, Rosen - 2020 - American Dialect Society.pdf){target="_blank"}, including a [published proceedings](pdf/Onosson, Rosen, Li - 2019 - ICPhS Proceedings.pdf){target="_blank"}, with another article currently under peer review. 

* **Phonetic analysis of *Hul'q'umi'num'* and *Tsilhqot'in* (Indigenous Languages of British Columbia).** This work is a collaboration with [Dr. Sonya Bird](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/linguistics/people/faculty/birdsonya.php){target="_blank"} (University of Victoria), involving the Coast Salish language *Hul'q'umi'num'* spoken on Vancouver Island, and the Athabaskan language *Tsilhqot'in* spoken in the interior of B.C. My prior work on Hul'q'umi'num' has involved comparing production differences between fluent elders and language learners, which has produced two [conference presentations](pdf/Onosson - 2019 - Prairie Workshop on Languages and Linguistics V.pdf){target="_blank"}, including a [published proceedings](pdf/Onosson, Bird - 2019 - ICPhS Proceedings.pdf){target="_blank"}. Currently, I am part of a larger research team which will focus on child language acquisition/development in Hul'q'umi'num'.
