## Welcome

I am currently in the process of moving my personal site over to *GitHub pages*, where you retrieving this page from. If there are errors or anything breaks, I should get around to fixing it shortly.

This site contains information on my work as a **[Linguist](research.html)**, including teaching and related resources. Currently I am adding materials related to a **[Workshop on Statistics for Linguistics](stats.html)**. There is also a page devoted to my career as a **[Musician](music.html)**. My time is mostly devoted to academic work in linguistics these days, although I still perform fairly regularly in various musical settings.
