## Welcome

This is my GitHub site. It replicates large parts of my personal website, but is geared more towards teaching and related resources.

Currently I am adding materials related to a Workshop on Statistics for Linguistics -- see the navigation bar above.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, the best way is by email at sky@onosson.com.

I also have an institutional email at Sky.Onosson@umanitoba.ca, although I don't check it as frequently.

[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sky_Onosson){target="_blank"} hosts a number of my academic papers and conference presentations.

My main [GitHub](https://github.com/onosson){target="_blank"} page hosts some of my Praat & R scripts and related materials, although most of these will not be publicly visible.

I have omitted my other social media information on this site, but if you would like those links you can head over to my regular website (which looks a lot like this one) at: [onosson.com](https://onosson.com){target="_blank"}. I believe it is good policy not to follow/friend current students on social media, however.
