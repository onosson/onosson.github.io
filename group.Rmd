* Plans are currently in the works for a **Coding Discussion Group** for the Linguistics Department at the University of Manitoba, to take place in 2020
* Discussions will concern various aspects of the use of code-based software such as R, Praat, and LaTeX in linguistic research
* Anyone who is interested in participating should email me at <sky@onosson.com>
* Once we have a concrete schedule established, it will be posted here and distributed by email through the LING-Listserv mailing list
