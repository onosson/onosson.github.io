I'm pleased to be directing the upcoming **Coding Discussion Group** for the Linguistics Department at the University of Manitoba, to take place in 2020:

* Discussions will concern various aspects of the use of code-based software such as R, Praat, and LaTeX in linguistic research
* Anyone who is interested in participating should email me at <sky@onosson.com>
* Once we have a concrete schedule established, it will be posted here and distributed by email through the LING-Listserv mailing list

# Schedule

We have tentatively established the upcoming meeting dates as:

* February: Friday the 7th, 10:30--12;30
* March: Monday the 2nd, 12:30--2:30 
* April: Monday the 6th, 12:30--2:30

# Agenda

For the first meeting on Feb. 7, I have picked the theme of "vowel plotting". This is a topic we explored as part of one of the workshop meetings in December, but there are many more aspects which we can look at including:

* organizing/tidying data
* subsetting (e.g. by phonological context)
* normalization procedures
* formant trajectories
* GAMMs analysis
* etc.!

I will have some resources prepared for the meeting related to this theme. Also, please don't hesitate to bring in any questions/problems/topics you would like to discuss, even if they are not connected to the theme.
