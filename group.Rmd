I'm pleased to be directing the **Coding for Linguistics Discussion Group** for the Linguistics Department at the University of Manitoba:

* Meetings will be based around discussing various aspects of the use of code-based software such as R, Praat, and LaTeX in linguistic research
* To join our mailing list please email me at <sky@onosson.com>

# Agenda

For the first meeting on Feb. 7, I have picked the theme of "vowel plotting". This is a topic we explored as part of one of the workshop meetings in December, but there are many more aspects which we can look at including:

* organizing/tidying data
* subsetting (e.g. by phonological context)
* normalization procedures
* formant trajectories
* GAMMs analysis
* etc.!

I will have some resources prepared related to this theme. That being said, please don't hesitate to bring in any questions/problems/topics you would like to discuss, even if they are not connected to the theme.
