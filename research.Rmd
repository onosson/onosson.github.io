## Linguistics [`r fa("github", fill="steelblue")`](https://github.com/onosson){target="_blank"} [`r fa("researchgate", fill="steelblue")`](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sky_Onosson){target="_blank"} [`r fa("linkedin", fill="steelblue")`](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sky-onosson-57902870/){target="_blank"}

My research in linguistics revolves around the fields of acoustic phonetics, sociolinguistics, and articulatory phonology, with a dash of computational linguistics, which I see as a pretty natural and necessary connection in this day and age. A lot of my work has looked at the dynamic properties of vowel production, such as diphthongs, from both phonetic and phonological points of view.

The information on this page is the best compendium of my research, both active and historical, but there are also a few sites which I maintain for other purposes:

* I have an increasingly-active profile on [GitHub](https://github.com/onosson){target="_blank"}
* My [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sky_Onosson){target="_blank"} page contains the same publications/presentations listed below, although updates may lag behind this site
* I also try to keep [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sky-onosson-57902870/){target="_blank"} updated, although probably less diligently

### Current work and previous experience [`r fa("file-alt", fill="steelblue")`](pdf/OnossonCV.pdf){target="_blank"}

I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of Linguistics](https://umanitoba.ca/linguistics/){target="_blank"} at the [University of Manitoba](https://www.umanitoba.ca/){target="_blank"} as part of the [*Languages in the Prairies Project*](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~rosenn/sace.html){target="_blank"} spearheaded by [Dr. Nicole Rosen](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~rosenn/){target="_blank"} (see below).

I am currently coordinating the [Coding for Linguistics Discussion Group](https://onosson.github.io/UM_Discussion_Group/){target="_blank"} at the University of Manitoba, which began in February and is planned to continue throughout 2020 on a (semi-)monthly basis.

I am a graduate of both the [University of Manitoba](http://www.umanitoba.ca/linguistics/){target="_blank"} (B.A. and M.A.) and the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/linguistics/){target="_blank"} (Ph.D.).

My academic work and research experience includes teaching courses in Linguistics at the [University of Manitoba](http://www.umanitoba.ca/linguistics/){target="_blank"} and the [University of Winnipeg](https://www.uwinnipeg.ca/interdisciplinary-linguistics/index.html){target="_blank"}, serving as a research assistant and lab instructor at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/linguistics/){target="_blank"}, presenting at a variety of major linguistics conferences, and volunteering as editor and conference organizer on multiple occasions. 

[My academic CV](pdf/OnossonCV.pdf){target="_blank"} contains much more information on all of the above. I also have an [industry-facing resume](pdf/OnossonResume.pdf){target="_blank"} for non-academic purposes, should they arise.

### Research projects

I currently have several active research projects:

* **Vowel production and variation in Manitoba/Prairie English** The data for this research is drawn from [Dr. Nicole Rosen's](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~rosenn/){target="_blank"} Canada Research Chair-funded [*Languages in the Prairies Project*](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~rosenn/sace.html){target="_blank"} (LIPP). My research on LIPP has led to two [conference presentations](pdf/Onosson,%20Rosen%20-%202020%20-%20American%20Dialect%20Society.pdf){target="_blank"}, including a [published proceedings](pdf/Onosson,%20Rosen,%20Li%20-%202019%20-%20ICPhS%20Proceedings.pdf){target="_blank"}; a full article is currently being prepared for peer review. Significant findings from this research include the documentation of distinctive ethnolinguistic patterns across several phonological processes in the Filipino and Mennonite communities in Manitoba.

* **Vowel dynamics of North American English** This work stems from my [M.A.](pdf/Onosson%20-%202010%20-%20MA%20Thesis.pdf){target="_blank"} and [Ph.D.](pdf/Onosson%20-%202018%20-%20PhD%20Dissertation.pdf){target="_blank"} graduate work, which focused on "Canadian Raising" of the /aj/ and /aw/ diphthongs before voiceless codas. I am interested in the ways that different dialects handle pre-voiceless shortening in general, and how this plays out in the context of what are perceived as "raised" diphthongal nuclei.

* **Variation and change in contemporary Brazilian Portuguese** Beginning in 2015, in collaboration with [Christiani Pinheiro Thompson](https://artsandscience.usask.ca/linguistics/graduates/current-graduate-students.php){target="_blank"} (University of Saskatchewan), we have recorded more than 80 multi-media intervews with nearly 180 middle-school children in urban Rio de Janeiro. Currently we are focusing on carrying out the lengthy process of transcription, after which we plan to document many of the [interesting linguistic innovations](pdf/Thompson,%20Onosson%20-%202016%20-%20New%20Ways%20of%20Analyzing%20Variation%2045.pdf){target="_blank"} taking place in this community, which include lexical, syntactic, and phonological features among others.

* **Descriptive phonetic analysis of Indigenous Languages of British Columbia** This work is being conducted in collaboration with [Dr. Sonya Bird](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/linguistics/people/faculty/birdsonya.php){target="_blank"} (University of Victoria), and focuses on two Indigenous languages: the Coast Salish language *Hul'q'umi'num'* spoken on Vancouver Island, and the Athabaskan language *Tsilhqot'in* spoken in the interior of B.C. Work on *Hul'q'umi'num'* has involved application of techniques for the analysis of dynamic acoustic patterns to compare production differences between fluent elders and language learners to assist in the language learning process. This work has produced two [conference presentations](pdf/Onosson%20-%202019%20-%20Prairie%20Workshop%20on%20Languages%20and%20Linguistics%20V.pdf){target="_blank"}, including a [published proceedings](pdf/Onosson,%20Bird%20-%202019%20-%20ICPhS%20Proceedings.pdf){target="_blank"}. My work on *Tsilhqot'in* is focused on the acoustics of consonants, which is a new area for me, and a paper resulting from this collaboration is currently in prep.

* **Vowel production in the Ecuadorian mixed language *Media Lengua*.** This project is a collaboration with [Dr. Jesse Stewart](http://www.jessestewart.net/){target="_blank"} (University of Saskatchewan). The lexicon of Media Lengua derives from both Quichua and Spanish. Our current work focuses on how vowel-sequences from different-origin source languages are handled in Media Lengua, from both phonetic and phonological perspectives. A paper resulting from this collaboration is currently in prep.
