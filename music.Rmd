## Music

<big>
I've been a musician since the age of five, starting on keyboards and then moving on to bass, guitar, and saxophone (briefly). I started working pretty much full-time in music right out of high school playing bass and keyboards with my group [The New Meanies](https://www.facebook.com/TheNewMeanies){target="_blank"} (formerly the Blue Meanies). We released four albums since forming around 1990, including "Three Seeds" under Virgin Records, as well as the indie follow-up to that, "Highways". We haven't done very much recording-wise over the past decade, but we still play 2--3 shows a year in and around Winnipeg.

Over the course of my career as a musician, I've had the privilege of opening for a number of world-class artists including *Deep Purple, Dave Matthews Band, Alice Cooper, Paul Rodgers (of Queen and Bad Company), Little Feat, Parliament/Funkadelic, The Beach Boys,* and *Bruce Cockburn*, among others. The Meanies were nominated in 1999 for two Juno awards including *Best New Group* and *Album Design*, and won a Prairie Music Award for the video for "Letting Time Pass".

As a sideman and session musician, I've played and recorded with many notable current and former Winnipeg artists such as *Sweet Alibi, Whitehorse, Sarah Dugas, Scott Nolan, Brandy Zdan, Dan Frechette, AEL, The Guerrillas of Soul, Romi Mayes, The Perpetrators, Twilight Hotel,* and *Matt Epp*, just to name a few.
